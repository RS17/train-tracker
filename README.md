# train-tracker
Project for easily getting access to train data, analyzing, and creating REST API for access (in development)

Currently works for getting SEPTA (Philadephia local regional rail) data only.  The design is intended to be modular and easily extendable and allow easy database setup with different systems.  However it's still definitely a work in progress.  

This will not work out of the box and requires some minimal database setup.  Contact me at rsuriprog@gmail.com if you're intending to make this into your own project and I'd be glad to provide some quick help.
